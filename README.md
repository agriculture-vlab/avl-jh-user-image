# AVL user environment docker image configuration

This repository contains a configuration (currently just a dockerfile)
for a docker image to be used as a custom user environment in JupyterHub.
This allows us to preinstall relevant packages (xcube, etc.). See
https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jupyterhub/customizing/user-environment.html for more details.
